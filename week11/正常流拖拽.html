      Thank you. Thank you very much, everyone. Sorry to keep you waiting.
      Complicated business, complicated. Thank you very much. I've just received
      a call from Secretary Clinton. She congratulated us. Itâ€™s about us. On our
      victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very
      hard-fought campaign. I mean she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very
      long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt
      of gratitude for her service to our country. I mean that very sincerely.
      Now it is time for America to bind the wounds of pision, have to get
      together, to all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this
      nation I say it is time for us to come together as one united people. It
      is time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president
      for all of Americans, and this is so important to me. For those who have
      chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people,
      I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can
      work together and unify our great country. As I've said from the
      beginning, ours was not a campaign but rather an incredible and great
      movement, made up of millions of hard-working men and women who love their
      country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their
      family. It is a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions,
      backgrounds and beliefs, who want and expect our government to serve the
      people, and serve the people it will. Working together we will begin the
      urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've
      spent my entire life in business, looking at the untapped potential in
      projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do
      for our country. Tremendous potential. I've gotten to know our country so
      well. Tremendous potential. It is going to be a beautiful thing. Every
      single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest
      potential. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no
      longer. We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways,
      bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our
      infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none, and we will
      put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. We will also finally
      take care of our great veterans who have been so loyal, and I've gotten to
      know so many over this 18-month journey.
